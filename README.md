# Tealium Mobile Library for iOS

<img align="left" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dfpz40r7j/image/upload/v1479312678/warning-icon-60_yd8bwd.png"> This library has been superseded by the [Tealium Swift Library](tealium-swift). It continues to function with the Tealium platform, but we strongly recommend migrating to the Swift library for the best experience. All data from this library is automatically imported by the Swift library on first launch. Should you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at [https://support.tealiumiq.com](https://support.tealiumiq.com), or raise an [issue](/issues).
